negative,"at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave ."
negative,"the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental ."
negative,"as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting ."
negative,the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
negative,"there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff ."
negative,"it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy ."
negative,"denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others ."
negative,the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
negative,"one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution ."
negative,serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs .
negative,"the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take ."
negative,"with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge ."
negative,"stale , futile scenario ."
negative,"deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness ."
negative,"a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment ."
negative,like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .
negative,it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt .
negative,the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
negative,another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
negative,"shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere ."
negative,i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
negative,"complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort"
negative,"though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining ."
negative,"something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously ."
negative,it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
negative,"on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality ."
negative,the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
negative,"offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm ."
negative,makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
negative,the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
negative,"although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun ."
negative,"it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff ."
negative,"bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad ."
negative,may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
negative,"if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter ."
negative,not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
negative,"the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died ."
negative,davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is .
negative,"the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves ."
negative,"the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult ."
negative,historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
negative,long time dead ? not nearly long enough .
negative,nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .
negative,a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .
negative,there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
negative,"the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays ."
negative,"perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie ."
negative,verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
negative,"mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script ."
negative,an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes .
negative,"skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt ."
negative,who needs love like this ?
negative,hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story .
negative,"returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy ."
negative,exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .
negative,"trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive ."
negative,"mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity ."
negative,"it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks ."
negative,"whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy ."
negative,it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
negative,a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes .
negative,nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
negative,i'm just too bored to care .
negative,"irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater ."
negative,not a stereotype is omitted nor a clichÚ left unsaid .
negative,"as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear ."
negative,attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .
negative,it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong .
